get pave = average score for 10 rows and 10 columns of face

for the left side:
    get p0 = P-score of left-most column (or two)
    var = True
    

    
    while var:
        if(P-score of left column < .9 pave):
            change face.coordinates[0][0] += 1
        else:
            var = False
    
    var = True
    while var:
        if(P-score of next left column > .9 p0): #VAR
            change  face.coordinates[0][0] -= 1
        else:
            var = False
        
        
repeat for other 3 sides

maybe check for width/height consistency.  lean towards width being more accurate (necks, etc)
